I'm kind of looking forward to my full retirement end of August 2010. Glad to hear all is well with you and look forward to seeing you sometime. We will try to make big plans for next Christmas maybe. I'll try. Glad your company is doing well. You didn't let me know if you got your diploma from Berkeley. God Bless and your dad still loves you. Love DAD",

    "context": "Hi Dad,\n\nHope your trip back was a good one. I suppose you are in Resolute Bay by this time. Two more years until retirement? I think that is the first time I have heard such an exact date for retirement from you.\n\nI definitely want to come and visit soon, but when? I was thinking I would be going to Anne's graduation in May and then came to realize that it is also Stevie's graduation coming up in May. So, I am feeling pretty torn. What/When are the plans for Anne's graduation?\n\nThe car has been giving me some trouble. My old hip injury has been acting up from the high clutch. I've been ignoring it for a while, but the last couple of weeks have been sorta unbearable so I've seen the doctor. I am taking steroids to get the swelling down, but essentially I need to either buy a new car (automatic) or a new clutch. Any suggestions? Daniel, my housemate, is convincing me that with craigslist I could probably do it pretty quickly. We shall see.\n\nAs for the diploma, not yet. I have meant to walk down to the school and talk to the registrar, but the times I've had available to do that have either been during the holidays or the beginning of the semester (when it is hours of waiting). I will be looking into it this week.\n\nPlease thank Margaret for the Valentine. It sounds like she likes Powell River. Unfortunately, I won't be able to make Pat's birthday with all the trips I am hoping to make this year (graduation, wedding and a Christmas).\n\nIt's good to hear from you,\n\nMuch love,\n\n-ruth",

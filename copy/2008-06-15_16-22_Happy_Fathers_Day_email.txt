Hi Dad,

I got a number from Margaret this week hoping that I would get to wish
you a Happy Father's Day over the phone. But the number didn't work,
so I am sending along my best wishes in an email.

Things are going well for me and I still really like my job. There has
been a lot going on and I need to focus and find a place to live in
order to move on to the next stage of my life. I am looking forward to
it, but also a little afraid of all the change.

Hope things are good,

much love,

Hi daughter.  I don't check my netkaster as much as I should and just received your very appreciated email. I haven't seen a live Polar Bear this tour yet but sure have come close. There was one run out of town two days ago. Just about the time I took the pictures of the Coop. I've been flying support for some of the Arctic expedition but none to the pole this year. I just resupplied Will Steigar from Minnisota's Ellesmere Expedition. The saw about  
30 polar bears travelling norht of here on their way  around Axel Heiberg Island to Eureka. I was in Eureka today but neglected to take pictures as I already have to many. 
I really happy for you in the job and hope you can find accomadations closer to work. That is a lot better than driving. With Automobile costs and fuel doubling. 
Have you got your diploma yet?
Anne is working in Fort Nelson for the summer and I'm not sure where she will be next fall.
I'll keep sending the pics . They are quite small and you can delete the ones that mean nothing to you.  Thinking of you and wishing you the best . 
Love DAD

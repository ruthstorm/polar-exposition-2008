
Hi Daughter .  So good to get the reply. I'm back in Vancouver on the 12th of Feb. I was hoping to do another tour down here but they have me scheduled for Resolute Bay again. I'm kind of looking forward to my full retirement end of August 2010. Glad to hear all is well with you and look forward to seeing you sometime. We will try to make big plans for next xmas maybe. I'll try. Glad your company is dooing well. You didn't let me know if you got your diploma from Berkely. God Bless and your dad still loves you.  luv DAD

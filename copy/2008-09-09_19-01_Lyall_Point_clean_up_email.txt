
1. Roberts Bay on Cameron Island is old Hurc strip used during oil and gas exploration in the 70s
2. FN10 identical to one I sold two years ago
3. A Bombi bombadier snow machine very similar to J3
4. The S61 slinging in one of the last loads before I took the crew to Cambridge Bay
5 A D4 Cat in pristine condition. Rollers and tracks like brand new after over 30years sitting on Cameron Island
This equipment will be air lifted to Resolute Bay by Hurc sometime this winter. They said they would then give away the equipment to whoever wanted it as it cost so much to ship it out and it is over 30yrs old. Most of this equipment ran with a new battery.    cheers  Marshall Paul {:)

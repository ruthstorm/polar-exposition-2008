Hi Dad,

Hope your trip back was a good one. I suppose you are in Resolute Bay
by this time. Two more years until retirement? I think that is the
first time I have heard such an exact date for retirement from you.

I definitely want to come and visit soon, but when? I was thinking I
would be going to Anne's graduation in May and then came to realize
that it is also Stevie's graduation coming up in May. So, I am feeling
pretty torn. What/When are the plans for Anne's graduation?

The car has been giving me some trouble. My old hip injury has been
acting up from the high clutch. I've been ignoring it for a while, but
the last couple of weeks have been sorta unbearable so I've seen the
doctor. I am taking steroids to get the swelling down, but essentially
I need to either buy a new car (automatic) or a new clutch. An
suggestions? Daniel, my housemate, is convincing me that with
craigslist I could probably do it pretty quickly. We shall see.

As for the diploma, not yet. I have meant to walk down to the school
and talk to the registrar, but the times I've had available to do that
have either been during the holidays or the beginning of the semester
(when it is hours of waiting). I will be looking into it this week.

Please thank Margaret for the Valentine. It sounds like she likes
Powell River. Unfortunately, I won't be able to make Pat's birthday
with all the trips I am hoping to make this year (graduation, wedding
and a Christmas).

It's good to hear from you,

much love,

-ruth
